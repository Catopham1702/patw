## Description

This Python script is designed to retrieve data from an SQLite database based on a configuration value. It uses the `sqlite3` library to connect to a database file named "database.db" and execute a SQL query.

## Inputs

- **value**: A string representing the value to be used in the WHERE clause of the SQL query.

## Outputs

- The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row of data retrieved from the database.

## Usage

To use this script, you would typically call the `get_data_by_config_value` function with a specific value. For example:

```python
result = get_data_by_config_value("admin")
print(result)
```

This would execute the SQL query to retrieve all rows from the "users" table where the "username" column matches "admin".

## Configuration

The script uses a configuration dictionary named `CONFIG` to specify the default table and column names. These values can be modified to customize the behavior of the script.

```python
CONFIG = {
    "default_table": "users", 
    "default_column": "username"
}
```
