## Description
This Python script is designed to retrieve data from an SQLite database based on a configuration value. It uses a predefined table and column specified in the `CONFIG` dictionary.

## Inputs
- **value**: A string representing the value to be used in the SQL query.

## Outputs
- The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row of data retrieved from the database.

## Usage Example
```python
result = get_data_by_config_value("admin")
print(result)
```

This will execute the SQL query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=admin` and print the result.

## Dependencies
- The script requires the `sqlite3` module, which is a built-in Python library for working with SQLite databases.

## Description
This Python script contains unit tests for the `get_data_by_config_value` function in `index.py`. It uses the `unittest` framework and `unittest.mock` to mock database connections and cursor operations.

## Inputs
- None, as it is a test script.

## Outputs
- The test results are printed to the console when the script is run.

## Usage Example
To run the tests, execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python test_file.py
```

This will execute all the unit tests defined in `test_file.py` and display the results.
