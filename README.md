## Description
This Python script is designed to retrieve data from an SQLite database based on a configuration value. It uses a predefined table and column specified in the `CONFIG` dictionary.

## Inputs
- **value**: A string representing the value to be used in the SQL query.

## Outputs
- The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row of data retrieved from the database.

## Usage Example
```python
result = get_data_by_config_value("admin")
print(result)
```

This will execute the SQL query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=admin` and print the result.

## Dependencies
- The script requires the `sqlite3` module, which is a built-in Python library for working with SQLite databases.
