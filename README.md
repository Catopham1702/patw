## Description
This Python script is designed to retrieve data from a SQLite database based on configuration settings. It defines a function `get_data_by_config_value` that constructs and executes an SQL query using the default table and column specified in the `CONFIG` dictionary.

## Inputs
- **value**: A string representing the value to search for in the configured column of the database.

## Outputs
- Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row from the database that matches the search criteria.

## Usage
This script is intended to be used as part of a larger application that requires data retrieval from a SQLite database. It can be easily integrated into other Python scripts or modules by importing and calling the `get_data_by_config_value` function with the appropriate value.

## Example
```python
# Importing the module containing the function
from patw.index import get_data_by_config_value

# Calling the function with a specific value to retrieve data
data = get_data_by_config_value("admin")
print(data)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `get_data_by_config_value` function to fetch data from the database where the username is "admin". The result will be printed to the console.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- sqlite3 (Python's built-in SQLite library)
